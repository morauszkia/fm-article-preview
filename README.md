## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Using responsiveness best practices (units, sizing, etc.)

### Continued development

I am looking forward to anchor positioning gaining browser support, so that I can use a more robust solution to position the share menu on larger screens.
